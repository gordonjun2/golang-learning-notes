Contains notes and examples from my Golang programming learning journey

# Useful Website
- [Checkers in Go](https://github.com/batkinson/checkers-go)

# Tips
- When using ```go test``` and the *go: cannot find main module* message is shown, this means that the current directory is not recognized as a Go module. To create one, run
```
go mod init <module-name>
```
